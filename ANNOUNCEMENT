The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.31.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release adds support for new braille tables, such as Thai
contracted and Greek International US, and updates existing braille
tables such as the Finnish table which has been updated to the latest
braille standard. Benehalo has uncovered a number of security problems
in the liblouis code and has thankfully also provided fixes for them by
hardening the code.

I'd like to thank all the very dedicated contributors for helping to
push liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

New features
------------

-  None

Bug fixes
---------

-  Benehalo discovered quite a number of security problems and kindly
   enough also just fixed them by adding some check guards and making
   the code more robust.

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  Hungarian improvements (added more exceptions) thanks to Attila
   Hammer.
-  The usage of ``match`` opcodes with empty pre- and post patterns,
   e.g. ``match - disk - 145-24-16`` in some tables has been replaced
   with plain old ``always`` opcodes, as their implementation is much
   faster.
-  A change to the Spanish back-translation that went into the last
   release was reverted as it caused more problems than it solved.
-  The Dutch display table has been improved thanks to Bert Frees.
-  The Finnish table has been updated to reflect the latest Finnish
   braille standard from 2021 (Pistekirjoituksen perusteet, 2021) thanks
   to Sami Maatta from Celia.
-  Added a new Thai contracted braille table according to the guidelines
   of "Thai Braille Use Manual" of the National Braille Promotion and
   Development Fund. Thanks to Chatupol Nootatong.
-  Add a table for Greek International US braille. This table is based
   on the composed Greek characters, unlike the existing English table
   which is based on the decomposed system. Thanks to Sarah Blake LaRose
   and Leonard de Ruijter.
